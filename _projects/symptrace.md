Symptrace LLC is a startup I opened with two friends during the COVID pandemic. We were motivated by the need for 
devices that detect COVID symptoms and tracks the spread of the disease.
Currently, our company specializes in building medical information systems that enable seamless access and transfer
of medical history of patients between their doctors.
Our systems attempt to address information gaps between doctors and patients in developing countries.
