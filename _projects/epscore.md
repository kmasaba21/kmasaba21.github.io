The EPSCOR blooms project is a cross-site, NSF-Funded research project that aims at developing low-cost robots
and high performance algorithms that enable sustainable water quality monitoring. Guided by limnologists, roboticists
design robotic equipment that automates the traditional approach of monitoring aquatic processes to enable high 
temporal and spatial resolution sampling. For details please visit the EPSCOR blooms <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/epscor-blooms/">page</a> and related research <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9620554">work</a>.
