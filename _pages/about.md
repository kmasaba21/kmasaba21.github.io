 I am a Computer Science PhD Candidate specializing in Robotics at Dartmouth College. My research specializes in addressing challenges within multi-robot environment exploration in my research. This field finds applications in diverse areas such as environmental monitoring, autonomous driving, precision agriculture, warehouse automation, object tracking, robot assembly, and beyond. My focus is on overcoming the constraints of low-cost robot teams when navigating expansive or communication-restricted environments, which includes minimizing operating costs, mitigating the impact of low computational power, managing limited energy resources, addressing communication limitations, and navigating obstaclesâ€”all aimed at optimizing the overall performance of robots in such scenarios. To achieve this, I exploit topological structures and spatiotemporal properties of environments to create informative path planners for mobile robots using various stochastic models from Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and simulation tools.

My research work, funded by a $5.6M NSF grant, aims to address the limitations of low cost robot teams in exploring large and/or communication constrained environments, such as minimizing the operating costs, mitigating the effect of low computational power, limited energy, poor communication, and obstacles on the overall performance of robots. I have also assisted in teaching five courses in computer science at Dartmouth College, and upgraded the legacy prepaid electric meter token generation system at PivotAccess, a software company that specializes in prepaid utility bill payments across Rwanda. I am currently seeking a job opportunity in the robotics or data analytics industry, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems in industry.
