I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon Robotics, specializing in multi-agent path optimization for warehouse automation.  I recently graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Dartmouth College. My PhD thesis addresses some of the limitations of low-cost robot teams in exploring large and/or communication constrained environments, such as minimizing the operating costs, mitigating the effect of low computational power, limited energy, poor communication, and obstacles on the overall performance of robots. 

Overall, my research interests include multi-agent path finding and multi-robot environment exploration, a field that has applications in environmental monitoring, autonomous driving, precision agriculture, warehouse automation, object tracking, robot manufacturing, and more.
