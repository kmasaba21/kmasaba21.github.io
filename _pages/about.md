 I am a Computer Science PhD Candidate specializing in Robotics at Dartmouth College. I am passionate about solving challenges in multi robot environment exploration, a field that has applications in environmental monitoring, autonomous driving, precision agriculture, warehouse automation, object tracking, robot manufacturing, and more. I have over six years of experience in designing methods for robot coordination, communication, perception, obstacle avoidance, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, using various mathematical techniques and web frameworks.

My research work, funded by a $5.6M NSF grant, aims to address the limitations of low cost robot teams in exploring large and/or communication constrained environments, such as minimizing the operating costs, mitigating the effect of low computational power, limited energy, poor communication, and obstacles on the overall performance of robots. I have also assisted in teaching five courses in computer science at Dartmouth College, and upgraded the legacy prepaid electric meter token generation system at PivotAccess, a software company that specializes in prepaid utility bill payments across Rwanda. I am currently seeking a job opportunity in the robotics or data analytics industry, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems in industry.
